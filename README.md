# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

This interactive dashboard analyzes over **1 million rows** of sales data sourced from a **MySQL database**. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into sales performance, regional performance, and product-level trends. The dashboard is fully dynamic with drill-throughs, KPIs, and custom visuals for business decision-making.

---

## ✨ Project Goals

- Monitor and optimize sales performance across multiple dimensions (Region, Product, Store)
- Identify high-performing regions and underperforming stores
- Enable dynamic filtering, drill-downs, and slicers for user-driven insights
- Build a scalable BI solution that reflects real-world business needs

---

## 🔍 Business Case

A company wants to visualize their sales operations across **regions and stores** to understand:

- 📈 Which regions drive the most revenue?
- 🏬 Which stores underperform compared to average?
- 📦 What are the best-selling products?
- 📅 How do sales trend over time?

By integrating **Power BI with MySQL**, this dashboard simulates a real enterprise-level reporting solution.

## 🗄️ SQL Data Preparation

The sales dataset was stored and cleaned using **MySQL** before importing into Power BI. The following steps were performed using SQL queries:

- 📌 Created `sales_data`, `products`, and `store_info` tables
- 🧹 Removed NULLs and duplicates
- 📊 Performed revenue calculations
- 🗃️ Created lookup relationships between stores and products

You can view the full SQL script in the [`sql`](https://github.com/shraddhalahare17/Sales-Performance-Optimization-Project/blob/main/sql) folder.

> 💡 Tip: If you're exploring or want to replicate this project, you can run the queries to generate the same cleaned dataset structure in your MySQL database.
